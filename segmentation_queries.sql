SELECT Attrition_Flag, COUNT(*) AS total_customers
FROM customers
GROUP BY Attrition_Flag;
-- Insight: Out of 10127 total customers, 8500 customers are active and 1627 customers have churned. 
-- This shows that churn affects a smaller portion, but still represents a meaningful challenge.

-- Q2: Gender Distribution
SELECT Gender, COUNT(*) AS total_customers
FROM customers
GROUP BY Gender;
-- Insight: The customer base consists of 4769 males (47.6%) and 5358 females (53.5%). 
-- The near balance suggests gender-neutral marketing strategies are effective.

-- Q3: Education Level Distribution
SELECT Education_Level, COUNT(*) AS total_customers
FROM customers
GROUP BY Education_Level
ORDER BY total_customers DESC;
-- Insight: 3128 customers (32%) are Graduates, making them the largest group, followed by 2013 (20%). 
-- This shows that educated customers form the core base, suitable for premium offerings.

-- Q4: Marital Status Distribution
SELECT Marital_Status, COUNT(*) AS total_customers
FROM customers
GROUP BY Marital_Status;
-- Insight: 4687 customers (___%) are Married, compared to 3943 (___%) who are Single, and 1497 (___%) in other categories.

FROM customers

-- Insight: Active customers hold an average credit limit of 8726 compared to 8136  for churned customers. 
-- This indicates that higher-limit customers are more valuable and loyal.

-- Q6: Average Revolving Balance by Churn Status
SELECT Attrition_Flag, AVG(Total_Revolving_Bal) AS avg_revolving_balance
FROM customers
GROUP BY Attrition_Flag;
-- Insight: Active customers maintain an average revolving balance of 12256.60 versus 672.8230 for churned customers. 
-- Lower balances among churned users suggest weaker financial engagement.

-- Q7: Average Utilization Ratio by Churn Status
SELECT Attrition_Flag, AVG(Avg_Utilization_Ratio) AS avg_utilization_ratio
FROM customers
GROUP BY Attrition_Flag;
-- Insight: The average utilization ratio for active customers is 0.296836 compared to 0.162667 for churned customers. 
-- Higher utilization levels often correlate with greater churn risk.

-- Q8: Transaction Amount & Count by Churn Status
SELECT Attrition_Flag,
       AVG(Total_Trans_Amt) AS avg_transaction_amt,
       AVG(Total_Trans_Ct) AS avg_transaction_count
FROM customers
GROUP BY Attrition_Flag;
-- Insight: Active customers make 68 transactions on average, spending about 4654.
-- Churned customers make only 44 transactions, spending about  3095.
-- This confirms that strong transaction activity signals loyalty.

-- Q9: Average Inactive Months by Churn Status
SELECT Attrition_Flag, AVG(Months_Inactive_12_mon) AS avg_inactive_months
FROM customers
GROUP BY Attrition_Flag;
-- Insight: Churned customers are inactive for an average of 2.6 months versus 2.2 months for active customers. 
-- Extended inactivity is a strong churn predictor.

-- Q10: Average Contact Count by Churn Status
SELECT Attrition_Flag, AVG(Contacts_Count_12_mon) AS avg_contacts
FROM customers
GROUP BY Attrition_Flag;
-- Insight: Active customers made an average of 2.4 contacts in 12 months, 
-- while churned customers made 2.9. 
-- Very low or very high contact frequency signals higher churn risk.



-- Q11: Relationship count distribution by churn status
SELECT Attrition_Flag, Total_Relationship_Count, COUNT(*) AS customer_count
FROM customers
GROUP BY Attrition_Flag, Total_Relationship_Count
ORDER BY Total_Relationship_Count;
-- Insight: Customers with multiple product relationships (e.g., loans, cards, accounts) 
-- are less likely to churn, showing that cross-product engagement strengthens loyalty.

    WHEN Customer_Age < 30 THEN '<30'
    WHEN Customer_Age BETWEEN 30 AND 40 THEN '30-40'
    WHEN Customer_Age BETWEEN 41 AND 50 THEN '41-50'
    WHEN Customer_Age BETWEEN 51 AND 60 THEN '51-60'
    ELSE '60+' END AS age_group,
  Attrition_Flag,
  COUNT(*) AS customer_count
FROM customers
GROUP BY age_group, Attrition_Flag
ORDER BY age_group;
-- Insight: Middle-aged customers (40â€“50) show the highest churn tendency. 
-- This group may require more personalized engagement to maintain loyalty.

-- Q15: Churn Rate by Income + Card Category
SELECT Income_Category, Card_Category,
       SUM(CASE WHEN Attrition_Flag='Attrited Customer' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS churned,
       COUNT(*) AS total,
